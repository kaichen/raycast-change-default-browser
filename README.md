## Requirements

- macOS
- Xcode Command Line Tools (install with: `xcode-select --install`)

## Supported Browsers

- Safari
- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Brave Browser
- Arc
- And any other browser that registers itself as an http/https handler

## Usage

1. Open Raycast
2. Search for "Set Default Browser"
3. Select your preferred browser from the list
4. Press Enter to set it as default

## Technical Details

The extension consists of:
- A Swift script (`assets/defbrowser.swift`) that handles system-level browser switching
- A TypeScript/React component that provides the UI and calls the Swift script

No Homebrew or third-party CLI tools required!
